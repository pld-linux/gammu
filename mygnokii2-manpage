\fB\-\-nokiagetoperatorname\fR
       6110.c phones have place for name for one GSM network (of course, with flashing it's possible to change all names, bumygnokii2 is not flasher ;\-)). You can get this name using this option.

.TP 
\fB\-\-nokiatests\fR
       Make tests for Nokia DCT3 phones
       NOTE: EEPROM test can show error, when your phone has EEPROM in flash
             (like in 82xx/7110/62xx/33xx). The same Clock test will show error
             when phone doesn't have internal battery for clock (like 3xxx)

.TP 
\fB\-\-nokianetmonitor test\fR
       Takes output or set netmonitor for Nokia DCT3 phones.
       TIP: For more info about this option, please visit http://marcin\-wiacek.topnet.pl and read netmonitor manual.
       TIP: test 243 enables all tests (after using command "mygnokii \fB\-\-nokianetmonitor 243" in some phones like 6210 or 9210\fR have to reboot them to see netmonitor menu)

.TP 
\fB\-\-nokianetmonitor36\fR
       Reset counters from netmonitor test 36 in Nokia DCT3 phones.
       TIP: For more info about this option, please visit http://marcin\-wiacek.topnet.pl and read netmonitor manual.

.TP 
\fB\-\-nokiasetphonemenus\fR
       Enable all (?) possible menus for DCT3 Nokia phones:

       1. ALS (Alternative Line Service) option menu
       2. vibra menu for 3210
       3. 3315 features in 3310 5.45 and higher
       4. two additional games (React and Logic) for 3210 5.31 and higher

.TP 
\fB\-\-backup file\fR
       Backup your phone to file. It's possible to backup (depends on phone):

       * phonebook from SIM and phone memory
       * calendar notes
       * SMSC settings
       * operator logo
       * startup (static) logo or startup text
       * WAP bookmarks
       * WAP settings
       * caller logos and groups
       * user ringtones

       when use text backup files. List can be extended on request.

       TIP: if you will backup settings tmygnokii2 text file, it will be possible to edit it. It's easy: many things in this file will be written double \- once in Unicode, once in ASCII. When you will remove Unicode versionmygnokii2 will use ASCII on \fB\-\-restore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text, it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones \- it isn't important, what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \-> Unicode is done).

.TP 
\fB\-\-backupsms file\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-restore file\fR
       Restore settings written in file created using \fB\-\-backup option.\fR All things backup'ed by \fB\-\-backup (excluding WAP settings) can be\fR restored (when made backup tmygnokii2 text file).
