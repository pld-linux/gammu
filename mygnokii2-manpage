on \fB\-\-restore\fR (and you can easy edit ASCII text) and will convert it
according to your OS locale. When will be available Unicode version of text,
it will be used instead of ASCII (usefull with Unicode phones \- it isn't important,
what locale is set in computer and no conversion Unicode \-> ASCII and ASCII \->
Unicode is done).
